# Help About Configuration
isql.py uses a config file to hold default values for various settings.
######
The file is called **isql.cfg** and it is found in the users home directory/.isql
######
If the file does not exist at startup, the program will copy a baseline file to that directory.
In the event that you mess your config file up to the point where isql.py will not start, remove
the isql.cfg file in your home directory/.isql and restart isql.py to get a clean copy.
