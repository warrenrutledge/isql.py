# Help System
The help system is designed to be flexible and interactive for the user
##
**help** displays this screen
You can find a complete list of topics using **help topics**
##
The help files exist in a help directory and are written in markdown format.
The program uses the rich module and its Console() function to display the markdown.
There may be some issues with compatibility with other markdown displays.
## 
All help files are read dynamically when requested so if you want to change them
you can easily modify them in a text editor and check the output in **isql.py** without
exiting the program and reloading.
